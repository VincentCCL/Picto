*	\section intro Introduction
*
*	There are three main modules in <a href=http://projectile.is.cs.cmu.edu/research/public/tools/salm/salm.htm > SALM </a> : Indexing, Searching and Scanning.
*	To start, use IndexSA to index the corpus according to its suffix array.
*	This is the first step for all applications.
*	Once the corpus is indexed. We can use SALM to do all kinds of interesting process on this corpus.
*	\section search Applications based on searching the corpus
*	These applications searches for the occurrences of an n-gram or all the embedded n-grams of a sentence in the corpus.
*	\section scan Applications based on scanning the corpus
*	These applications scan through the corpus in a linear time and collects information such as the type/token frequency of the n-grams in the data.
*	\section lm Suffix Array Language Model
*	An online language model based on the suffix array indexing. Suffix array language model can use arbitrarily long history and very large corpus.
*	\section utils Utilities
*	Utility functions such as updating the universal ID vocabulary after observing a new corpus
